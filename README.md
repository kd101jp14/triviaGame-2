## About

This timed trivia was built on top of the code written for `triviaGame` (90s theme). Due to personal preference, changed the theme. Most of the essential code is the same. Mostly the visual aspects and text changed. The user is presented with a start display, which has a start button (the fish in this case). After pressing the start button, the trivia questions are displayed and the countdown begins. The user has 60 seconds to answer the questions. If the quiz is completed before 60 seconds, the user may click the submit button to view results. Whether the user presses the submit button or time runs out, the results are shown on a new display. The user has the option of restarting the quiz without refreshing the page.

### The Challenge

The primary challenge of this project was allowing the user to view different displays without creating separate pages. In order to overcome this challenge, parts of the code were hidden using .hide(), while others were displayed using .show(), depending on the circumstances.

This was also the first project to utilize a countdown. The timer was set to start as soon as the questions are displayed to the user. When the coundown reaches 0, the questions are hidden and the results are displayed.
