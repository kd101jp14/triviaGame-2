## About

* This timed trivia was built on top of the code written for `triviaGame` (90s theme). Due to personal preference, changed the theme. Most of the essential code is the same. Mostly the visual aspects and text changed. The user is presented with a start display, which has a start button (the fish in this case). After pressing the start button, the trivia questions are displayed and the countdown begins. The user has 60 seconds to answer the questions. If the quiz is completed before 60 seconds, the user may click the submit button to view results. Whether the user presses the submit button or time runs out, the results are shown on a new display. The user has the option of restarting the quiz without refreshing the page.
